# Heuristic strategies for cost-optimized institutional incentives in heterogeneous networked populations

## Overview
Through the use of incentives like punishment and rewards, policymaking institutions can encourage the abandonment of detrimental social norms. However, optimizing these in- centives is essential for minimizing costs while ensuring a desirable standard of cooperation, particularly in the context of green technology adoption. This work aims to investigate the optimization of incentives in a heterogeneous network with diverse populations. The results are expected to guide policymakers in balancing trade-offs for optimal interventions.
